# burger-logger

Are you hungry?  Eat some burgers!!  This is a web-based app that allows the user to "devour" a burger and create new burgers to be devoured.

## Getting Started
To use this app, just click on this link: https://burger-logger-02.herokuapp.com/

## Prerequisites
Google Chrome is recommended for running this program, but it may be run in any browser.

If downloading files to a local machine, the user must have Node.js installed and will need to have the packages installed with `npm install`

## Challenges
There were some challenges with this app - not all of the styling from the stylesheet would change the formatting in the index Handlebars file.  The color changes worked, but font and margin resizing had to be done with a `style=` in the tag being altered.

## Built With
* jQuery - to create the actions of the game
* CSS/Bootstrap - visuals for the webpage
* Node.js:
    * Express - package to create the server
    * mysql - package that connects app to MySQL database
    * Handlebars - package to help with front-end templates
    * Body-Parser - middelware package that works with Express to handle server requests
